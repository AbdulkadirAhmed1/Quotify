# Quotify

**Quotify** is a public, API-driven full stack project designed to manage, share, and display inspirational quotes through a clean, modern REST API and simple frontend interface.

Built with scalability, clarity, and best practices in mind, this project demonstrates key software engineering principles across both backend and frontend development. The backend leverages Python's FastAPI framework to deliver a fast, robust, and secure REST API, while MongoDB Atlas provides flexible NoSQL cloud storage for persistent data.

On the frontend, Quotify incorporates a lightweight, responsive interface using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript ‚Äî ideal for showcasing frontend fundamentals without heavy dependencies.

This project is intentionally structured to reflect professional software development workflows, including:

- Modular project organization  
- Consistent API standards with clear response formatting  
- Error handling and validation  
- Cloud deployment for real-world accessibility  

Quotify serves as both a learning tool and portfolio piece, ideal for demonstrating backend engineering, REST API design, database integration, and full stack project delivery. 

- Backend: FastAPI (Python) + MongoDB (Atlas)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS
- Database: NoSQL (MongoDB Atlas)
- Deployment: Render (Backend + Frontend)
