# Quotify

**Quotify** is more than just a project ‚Äî it's a clean, modern platform to collect, share, and celebrate inspirational quotes through a simple API and frontend interface.

This full stack app is designed to feel approachable but built with real-world, professional standards in mind. On the backend, we use Python's powerful FastAPI framework to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure API. MongoDB Atlas handles our data ‚Äî flexible, cloud-based storage to keep everything organized.

The frontend? No heavy frameworks here ‚Äî just pure, responsive HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It's intentionally lightweight to showcase how simple tools can still create something functional and polished.

**Why Quotify matters:**  
It's designed as a learning tool and portfolio project to demonstrate real backend engineering, API design, and clean full stack development ‚Äî the same principles recruiters love to see:

- Clear project structure  
- Professional API response standards  
- Error handling and validation  
- Cloud deployment for real-world use  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) + MongoDB (Atlas)  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Modular Vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- Database: NoSQL (MongoDB Atlas)  
- Deployment: Render (Backend + Frontend)
