## Features Completed

- FastAPI backend fully operational  
- MongoDB Atlas database connected using Async Motor client  
- Clean environment configuration using `.env`

## Available API Endpoints

### `GET /quotes/random`  
Returns a single random quote.  
If no quotes exist, returns a clear error message.

Returns a list of quotes with optional `skip` and `limit` controls:  
- `skip`: How many quotes to skip from the start (default `0`)  
- `limit`: Maximum number of quotes to return (default `10`)  
- Sorted by newest first (using `created_at` timestamp)  
- Returns error if no quotes found  

---

### `POST /quotes`  
Adds a new quote to the database.  
- Requires `text` and `author` fields  
- Automatically stores creation time (`created_at`)  
- Validates input for length and completeness

## Technical Enhancements

- Unified JSON response structure with `success`, `data`, `message`  
- Global error handlers for validation and API errors  
- Safe conversion of MongoDB `_id` to string for frontend compatibility  
- Ability to control list size with `skip` and `limit` parameters  
- Quotes sorted by newest first for consistency

## Backend Foundation Ready

The Quotify backend is stable, scalable, and production-ready for Phase 1 and Phase 2.
